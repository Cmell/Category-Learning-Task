The purpose of this study is to test your ability to learn to differentiate \
categories of stimuli.\
</p><p>\
Imagine that mankind has discovered a new planet, and you are one of the experts \
chosen to explore the planet for the first time. You discover two species of \
fungus on this planet: '+ fam1Name + 's and ' + fam2Name + 's. You know that \
they are different from genetic tests, but you cannot yet tell them apart just \
by looking at them. This computer program has identified several samples of \
the fungus, and it is going to help you learn to tell them apart.\
</p><p>\
The program will show you two enhanced images of the fungus at a time. You \
should do your best to learn which kind fungus is a ' + fam1Name + ', and which is a \
' + fam2Name + '. When you can complete 19 out of 20 identifications correctly, \
you will be finished learning the fungus. Good luck!\
