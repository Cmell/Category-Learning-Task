<H2>Fribble Stimulus Sets from the Work of Pepper Williams</H2>


This figure illustrates the exact structure of the prototype, p1e1, p2e0, p2e2, p3e1, and p4e2 exemplar sets for the Fribble stimuli used in several experiments.  Within each Fribble species, the exact shape, color, and texture of the main body and the approximate location and interrelationships between appendage parts are held constant for all exemplars.  Colors and textures of appendage parts are also similar (although not identical) across exemplars.  The main aspect that changes from exemplar to exemplar in a species is the exact shape of the appendage parts.  As illustrated in the Figure, three qualitatively different 3D volumes (i.e. different geons; Biederman 1987) could be "plugged in" to each appendage part socket.  Each individual exemplar is defined by a particular conjunction of appendage parts, with the particular exemplars making up the item sets (p1e1, p2e0, etc.) used in Experiments 1-5 specified in the text of the Figure.<p>

Exemplars specified here can be cross-referenced with the Fribble stimuli by noting that each Fribble image file is known as "Fxx_abcd", where "xx" is the species identifier, shown on the left side of this Figure, and "abcd" are the four appendage parts, as indicated in the Figure.  For example, the prototype of the top-most species is Fa2_1111 and the four p1e1 items are Fa2_1121, Fa2_3111, Fa2_1211, and Fa2_1113.<p>
